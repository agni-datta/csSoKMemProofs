## 2. Foundations and Preliminaries

- Mathematical foundations:
  - Group theory and algebraic structures
	  - Cyclic groups: $G = \langle g \rangle$, order $n$
	  - Polynomial rings: $R[X]$ and quotient rings $R[X]/(f(X))$
	  - Field extensions and algebraic closure
  - Elliptic curve cryptography
	  - Weierstrass form: $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$
	  - Group law: $P + Q = R$, point at infinity $O$
	  - Scalar multiplication: $[k]P = P + P + \ldots + P$ ($k$ times)
  - Bilinear pairings (Types I, II, and III)
	  - $e: G_1 \times G_2 \rightarrow G_T$, where $e(aP, bQ) = e(P, Q)^{ab}$
	  - Type I: $G_1 = G_2$
	  - Type II: $G_1 \neq G_2$, efficient homomorphism $\psi: G_2 \rightarrow G_1$
	  - Type III: $G_1 \neq G_2$, no efficient homomorphism
- Cryptographic primitives:
  - One-way functions and trapdoor permutations
	  - RSA function: $y = x^e \mod N$
	  - Discrete logarithm: $y = g^x$ in $G$
  - Collision-resistant hash functions
	  - Merkle-Damgård construction: $h_i = f(h_{i-1}, m_i)$
	  - Sponge construction: SHA-3 family
  - Merkle trees and hash-based data structures

	  - Given $(g, g^x, g^{x^2}, \ldots, g^{x^q})$, compute $(c, g^{1/(x+c)})$
  - Knowledge of Exponent Assumption (KEA)
	  - If $A$ outputs $(c, c^x)$ given $(g, g^x)$, it knows $a$ where $c = g^a$
- Security models and definitions:
  - Universal Composability (UC) framework
	  - Ideal functionality $F$ for membership proofs/accumulators
	  - Real-world protocol $\pi$ and simulator $S$

  - Game-based security definitions
	  - Completeness: $\Pr[\text{Verify}(x, S, \text{Prove}(x, S)) = 1 \mid x \in S] = 1$
	  - Soundness: $\Pr[\text{Verify}(x, S, \pi) = 1 \mid x \notin S] \leq \text{negl}(\lambda)$
	  - Zero-knowledge: $\{\text{View}_{\text{real}}\} \approx \{\text{View}_{\text{simulated}}\}$
